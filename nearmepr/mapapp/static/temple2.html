            Thiru Valiswaram or Bharadwajeswarar Temple, Kodambakkam.
            This temple is situated in a by lane off Best Hospital. 
            It is so called because the sage Bharadwaj and Vali worshipped the Sivalinga in this temple.
            There are stucco statues of both facing the main shrine  Moolavar is called Bharadwajeswarar
            and Ambal in a standing posture facing south is called Swarnambigai.  There are separate shrines 
            for Vinayaka, Subramanya, Bairavar, Ramanadheswar and Navagraha.  It is said that the temple is
            more than 700 years old and some chola era inscriptions are there on the west and north walls.
            However one cannot find anything may be due to the fact that the temple was renovated in 2015
            and many additions have been made.There is a chola era Adhi Ganapathy in standing posture which
            is kept just outside the main shrine.  The sthala viruksha is Nagalinga Tree.
